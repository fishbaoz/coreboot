config PAYLOAD_NONE
	bool "None"
	help
	  Select this option if you want to create an "empty" coreboot
	  ROM image for a certain mainboard, i.e. a coreboot ROM image
	  which does not yet contain a payload.

	  For such an image to be useful, you have to use 'cbfstool'
	  to add a payload to the ROM image later.

config PAYLOAD_ELF
	bool "An ELF executable payload"
	help
	  Select this option if you have a payload image (an ELF file)
	  which coreboot should run as soon as the basic hardware
	  initialization is completed.

	  You will be able to specify the location and file name of the
	  payload image later.

	  The path and filename of the ELF executable file to use as payload.

config COMPRESSED_PAYLOAD_LZMA
	bool "Use LZMA compression for payloads"
	default y
	depends on !PAYLOAD_NONE && !PAYLOAD_LINUX
	help
	  In order to reduce the size payloads take up in the ROM chip
	  coreboot can compress them using the LZMA algorithm.

config PAYLOAD_OPTIONS
	string
	default ""
	help
	  Additional cbfstool options for the payload

config PAYLOAD_IS_FLAT_BINARY
	def_bool n
	help
	  Add the payload to cbfs as a flat binary type instead of as an
	  elf payload

config COREINFO_SECONDARY_PAYLOAD
	bool "Load coreinfo as a secondary payload"
	default n
	depends on ARCH_X86
	help
	  coreinfo can be loaded as a secondary payload under SeaBIOS, GRUB,
	  or any other payload that can load additional payloads.

config MEMTEST_SECONDARY_PAYLOAD
	bool "Load Memtest86+ as a secondary payload"
	default n
	depends on ARCH_X86
	help
	  Memtest86+ can be loaded as a secondary payload under SeaBIOS, GRUB,
	  or any other payload that can load additional payloads.

config NVRAMCUI_SECONDARY_PAYLOAD
	bool "Load nvramcui as a secondary payload"
	default n
	depends on ARCH_X86
	help
	  nvramcui can be loaded as a secondary payload under SeaBIOS, GRUB,
	  or any other payload that can load additional payloads.
	  Currently nvramcui depends on PDncurses in libpayload, while coreinfo
	  uses tinycurses. They seems to be exclusive.
	  And please note the libpayload is not built automatically as coreinfo.
